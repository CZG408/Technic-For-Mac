# **THIS IS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR MAC | READ ENTIRE DOCUMENTATION FIRST**


*HAD TO HAVE THE .APP INSIDE A .ZIP IN ORDER TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB*


**Explanation:** I created this .app which runs the techniclauncher.jar which is built in. I did this so that the “unidentified developer” would no longer be a thing that appears so its basically removing an extra step. Image of popup I’m referring to: https://imgur.com/a/OewWhu8


**HOW TO SEE FILES / FOLDER HIERARCHY:** 
- Windows: Simply remove extension from .app and it will be able to be opened like any other folder 
- Mac: Right Click (or 2 finger click) icon, press "Show Package Contents"


**FOLDER HIERARCHY AND EXPLINATION:** 
1. "Contents" (self-explanatory):
     - "Info.plist" - .plist that holds required info for mac apps
     - "Java"
         - "TechnicLauncher.jar" -  regular .jar that is downloaded from website
     - "MacOS" 
          - "universalJavaApplicationStub" - It's the universal stub for java applications 
     -  "Resources" 
          -  "Technic.icns" - .icns is the format for icons on MacOS, its the Technic Icon that will be shown in MacOS dock (Picture of what I'm referring to: https://imgur.com/a/rsnOPAv


**BENEFITS OF USING THIS:**
1. 1: It will remove the popup created by apple regarding it possibly being malware. (https://imgur.com/a/OewWhu8) 
2. 2: It will show proper icon on dock: https://imgur.com/a/rsnOPAv 
3. 3: Players will be add it to their applications list (previously can't) by simply dragging and dropping it to their "Applications" folder Picture of it being in launchpad like every regular app: https://imgur.com/a/ZfVYFRU


**Future Proof:**
In the future if the .jar was to change it would be easy to update the .app since the process would be to simply erase the .jar that's located in contents/java and replace it with the new .jar, then simply save changes and it would be working with the new .jar without having issues.


# **UPDATE 1.2**


I have uploaded a .DMG which has technic launcher inside and a Alias (shortcut) folder so players simply drag the techniclauncher.app to the Applications alias and its installed like every other app.
Here is a video demonstrating how it works:
