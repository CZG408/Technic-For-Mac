***THIS IS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR MAC 
HAD TO HAVE THE .APP INSIDE A .ZIP IN ORDER TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB***


Explanation: I created this .app which runs the techniclauncher.jar built
in. I did this so that the “unidentified developer” would no longer be a
thing that appears so its basically removing an extra step. Image of
popup I’m referring to: https://imgur.com/a/OewWhu8

FOLDER HIERARCHY AND EXPLINATION: "Contents" (self-explanatory):
"Info.plist" - .plist that holds the icon and app name "Java" :
"TechnicLauncher.jar" - its the regular .jar provided by the website
"MacOS" "universalJavaApplicationStub" - It's the universal stub for
java applications "Resources" "Technic.icns" - .icns is the format for
icons on MacOS, its the Technic Icon that will be shown in MacOS dock
(Picture of what I'm referring to: https://imgur.com/a/rsnOPAv

HOW TO SEE FILES / FOLDER HIERARCHY: Windows: Simply remove extension
from .app and it will be able to be opened like any other folder Mac:
Right Click (or 2 finger click) icon, press "Show Package Contents"

BENEFITS OF USING THIS: 1: It will remove the popup created by apple
regarding it possibly being malware. (https://imgur.com/a/OewWhu8) 2: It
will show proper icon on dock: https://imgur.com/a/rsnOPAv 3: Players
will be add it to their applications list (previously can't) by simply
dragging and dropping it to their "Applications" folder Picture of it
being in launchpad like every regular app: https://imgur.com/a/ZfVYFRU
